I am officially almost done with University.

I have never actually written that sentence down before, and it was much more emotional than I thought it would be.

It is my second to last semester, assuming all things go to plan. Most things are still the same, playing tennis, chilling with friends, playing pokemon, browsing Github. Let me update you on what is a different this semester:

## Courses

* Artificial Intelligence
* Intro to Operating Systems
* Software Modeling & Design
* Computer Ethics
* Professional Development II
* Statistics for Engineers & Scientists
* Japanese IV

7 courses with a total of 18 credit hours. It is definitely a lot. On top of that, a lot of time is spent finding an internship over the Summer (I do have a solid update on that though ðŸ¤“).

## Artificial Intelligence

Easily and by far the most interesting class I am taking, very well could be the most interesting class offered at the University. 

One of, if not the most, difficult class I have taken so far. My professor is Shubhra Kanti Karmaker, who is lowkey a genius. Apparently he graduated valedictorian of his class at The Bangledesh University, then went to The University of Illinois but also spent some time at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology? How? Insane.

The lectures are boring but very important. Very technical and complex. At the beginning of the semester, there were many students enrolled that weren't computer science, and in the first class, the professor said "You all know how to code, right? You all know what data structures are? If you do not, you should probably drop this course." The programming assignments are very interesting, nothing I have ever worked on before.

## Operating Systems & Software Modeling

These classes are generally pretty easy. I am taking these both with the goat Dr. Xuechao Li. English is not his first language, so he speaks very slowly. However, he records his lectures so I don't have to go to class and I can listen to the recordings on 2x speed.

Projects are simple with lots of resources online. Exams are based on lectures with ample resourses provided by the professor.

## Ethics & Professional Development II

These classes I didn't really have to put these on my schedule for this semester. Ethics is usually a 3 credit hour course, but for whatever reason it is a 2 credit hour course, which means the courseload is lower than normal. Also, there was not a professor assigned to the course, so one of the CS advisors is teaching it. So it is ridiculously easy.

Pro Dev II is a second semester course that I describe as 'how to get a job' class. For example one of the assignments is to create a LinkedIn. All of these things recquired in this class I have already done, so I figured I would take it since it is an easy A that goes towards my GPA.

## Statistics

It's stats. Basically the exact same class as the recquired 'Intro to Statistics.'

## Japanese IV

æ—¥æœ¬èªžä¸Šæ‰‹ã€€ðŸ˜œ

Fourth semester Japanese. Pretty fire. I have it with Dr. Chris Kern. Pretty cool guy. I have had him pretty much my entire æ—¥æœ¬èªž career.

## Closing

Very busy semester.

Like I mentioned, I do have job news that I am waiting to post about until everything is finalized.

**Take a look at my Github, all the code and assignments I'm doing for these classes are uploaded to Github.**
