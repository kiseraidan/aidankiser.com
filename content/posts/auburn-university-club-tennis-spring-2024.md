It is has been an extremely busy semester, partly because the time I spent traveling with the Auburn University Club Tennis team this semester.

Here is a compilation of my favorite pictures & some notes:

## University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa
*3-4 February 2024*

This photo was during a very tight singles match against the University of Georgia. I did not play very well which is why the match was so close, and the guy hooked me on match point (a hook is when you call a ball that was in, out).

Overall, it was a very fun tournament and I am glad I was asked to go. My performance was not terrible, I went 1 for 3 in singles and 1 for 1 in mixed doubles.

## University of Tennessee, Knoxville
*17-18 February 2024*

This tournament was very cold! The above photo was taken moments before it started snowing!

Here is me getting hooked again.

## Southern Championships, Mobile, AL
*23-25 February 2024*

I played very well this tournament, which was a great bounce-back for me. This photo was taken during a men's doubles match against the University of Arkansas, where we won 6-1 and I had zero unforced errors.

I hate this picture of me because why are my shorts so long?

## Auburn University, Auburn
*23-24 March 2024*

Home tournament, home court advantage -- was not in place. Did bad.

Fun tournament of course though, I played the University of Tennessee in singles and I won 6-3, which is funny because they are good, and I have a 3-0 record in matches against Tennessee.
