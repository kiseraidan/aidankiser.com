I will spending my 2024 Summer with Nucor Steel in Decatur, AL as a Process Automation Engineer Intern.

The project(s) I will be working on are still unclear to me, but they have made the point to allow me to work on something that interests me. I was given ideas involving Unity, Arduinos, EdgeIoT, and Blockchain technologies.

I am excited for what my future holds with Nucor.
