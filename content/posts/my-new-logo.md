# What Do You Think?

I think it's pretty slick, if I do say so myself.

Only the most cultured may immediately recognize some of the inspiration here. It is a mix of a couple of my favorite pok√©mon, actually: [Porygon](https://www.pok√©mon.com/us/pokedex/porygon) and [Abomasnow](https://www.pok√©mon.com/us/pokedex/abomasnow). I wanted something that represented me in some of my more unique ways, but holds originality at the same time. 

Abomasow is the "Frost Tree" pok√©mon and Porygon is "Virtual" pok√©mon. Abomasnow represents my roots, being from Anchorage, Alaska, while Porygon represents one of my largest passions which is Computer Programming (since it isn't super obvious, Porygon is the first pok√©mon created by computer programming, according to pok√©mon lore).

I realize how nerdy that sounds.

# Why Though?

I don't know. Why not? I thought it would be fun to build a bit of a brand to my name, that is why this website exists. This logo will serve as my main identity for pretty much all things where I don't have to use my face, which is pretty much just [Github](https://github.com/kiseraidan).

# Credit

All credit goes to my talented friend Belle Shirley. I contracted her to create a logo for me back in May of 2023, with barely any creative direction. She did a great job creating the logo out of little information, and quickly shipped the product.
