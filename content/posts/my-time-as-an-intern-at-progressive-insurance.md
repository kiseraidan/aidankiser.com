## The Beginning

I started my first semester at Auburn University in August 2020 as a Neuroscience major. After about four semesters, I had a bit of an identity crisis and decided I didn't want to continue in my Neuroscience studies. But now, I need to find a field to pivot to. I visited my Software Engineer brother in San Francisco that next Spring break and he had me do a Python bootcamp. Immediately after, I switched to the College of Engineering in Computer Science, and I've never looked back.

I had made the switch in August of 2022. It being so late in my college career, yet so early in my software engineering career, I knew I would benefit enormously with an internship.

How in the world will I land a job in my first semester of engineering?

## The Introduction

During the second week of school, I attended my first engineering career fair. I had practiced my elevator pitch for hours. I went into the career fair and I spoke to every company that was looking to recruit software interns and co-ops. I am unsure how many companies I spoke to, but I was at the career fair from when the doors opened to when the doors closed. I even emailed several recruiters before-hand that I knew would be there, and tried to make an introduction that way (it worked). 

Fast foward to Progressive, I walked up to the two recruiters at the booth and began my pitch: "Hello, my name is Aidan Kiser, I am a software engineer studying computer science here..." And the recruiter stopped me and asked me why I cared to work for Progressive. I told him that from a software and tech standpoint, Progressive is very impressive. The use of algorithmic automation is very interesting to me, especially in insurance. After my little algorithm nerd shpeal I remember him saying "Alright Aidan, I like you, I want to set up an interview right now."

## The Interviews

I got in touch with the other recruiter that was there with the one that I spoke to, and he was the one I would do my screening with, because his background was much more technical. He asked me very broad questions about myself and a tad about my technical skills. It went very well and he allowed me to move forward for the final round of interviews.

The final was a massive group MS Teams call of about 100 recruits. They informed us that we would be talking to two interviewers each, both for thirty minutes. My first interview was with a Senior Software Developer (I don't remember the team oops) and he asked me several behavioral questions, but asked me to delve into more technical stories. The second, was barely an interview. My interviewer was a new grad, and we are pretty similar in age. It was a whole conversation, he asked me about the things I am passionate about, why I wanted to join Progressive, etc. 

**And, about two weeks later, I was given a call to deliver the news about the offer.**

## Onboarding

I was immediately given a mentor and HR manager, I would later find over time how great each of them were. I met with both at least weekly, most of the time more, however. My mentor was responsible for giving me my projects.

## Projects

She gave me three solo projects, and then I was assigned a fourth to be completed only with six other interns.

* I completed several [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) dashboards for several different teams. I used xml to log hundreds of servers for each team and their activity. With my dashboards, developers would be able to pinpoint strengths and weaknesses of the servers and provide the necessary maintenance when required.

* I completed a [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) dashboard displaying important data and analytics in the most visually appealing way.

* I created a **Python** program that was able to match the IP addresses to their respective managers within the company. I used linux and a remote IDE to be able to sneak past some permissions.

* Tasked with creating a presentation about whether or not **multilingual functionality** could be added to the internal **AI chatbot** within the company. Not only did we successfully acquire sufficient research to complete the task, we created a functional demo of a multingual [Flo chatbot](https://progressive.mediaroom.com/news-releases/?item=122478), fluent in English, Spanish, and Mandarin.

* I also was given the opportunity by my HR manager to give a **presentation about Japan** to an audience of nearly one-hundred people. One of the people in attendence, the current CIO of Progressive Insurance, [Steve Broz](https://investors.progressive.com/governance/board-of-directors/person-details/default.aspx?ItemId=3c91e6d5-d295-4608-9584-8a159605a371).

## I Regret Working at Progressive

I am just kidding.

My time with Progressive was ridiculously fun. The work was rewarding, the environment is phenomenal, and I made so may friends while being there.

If you have any questions for me regarding any part of my time with Progressive, please feel free to email me or DM me on instagram. 

Now, please enjoy these two picures of some friends I met and the Guardians stadium that I took while I was in Cleveland.
