It is currently my third week here at Nucor and I'm happy to report that I am working on some pretty cool projects.

** Insert picture

 I have been given a couple projects already, one inolving a high-power Nano camera and some C#. Another one involving a web and mobile applications made from Kotlin. 

Where I'm located is Decatur, AL at one of Nucor's sheet mills. On site is a melt shop, hot mill, and cold mill. They melt giant amounts of scrap metal in the melt shop, shape it and turn it into sheets in the hot mill, and add smaller or more specific details to the steel in the cold mill. 

I sit in a little office space on the second floor inside the hot mill. It is depressingly dark because of old lights and a lack of windows, so I often sneak out to steal some vitamin D. The cell service is non-existent as well.

Other than that, it is a pretty sweet gig. I often remind myself I'm getting paid more than most of the engineers and metallurgists on site even though I'm an intern. The people here are also very nice and welcoming.

The typical person working on-site is a southern male who has lived their entire life in the area, which has it's ups and downs. The people here are relatively simple, linear and straight. However, conversations are very easy and free-flowing. There doesn't exist a corporate layer over every conversation and interaction like there was at my former job. I don't feel pressured to not be myself and I feel comfortable talking to anyone here.

My boss/supervisor is the only exception. I don't know the entire story, but he is a Welsh man that immigrated to America, and has an American daughter. He is extremely smart, very high intelligence, in which you can tell just by speaking with him. He thinks in riddles and quotes just like any old-timey man from the UK. The best way I can imprint him into your brain is if you imagine a 60 year-old British historian. That is him, except an Engineer and Welsh.

Overall an eventful first few weeks. I have had countless 'firsts' whilst being here. The work being done here is an insane feat of engineering and it is hard to fathom what all goes on around here. 

Not to mention anything moving can kill you.
